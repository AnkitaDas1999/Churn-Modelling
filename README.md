# Churn-Modelling
Information of 10000 customers of a bank is provided in a dataset. The bank has been seeing unusual churn rates and the bank wants to understand the problem and wants to assess and address the problem. Therefore, an ANN has been built to predict the disturbances which enables the authorities to take precautionary action to minimize the impact.
