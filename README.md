# Churn-Modelling
Information of 10000 customers of a bank is provided in a dataset. The bank has been seeing unusual churn rates and it wants to understand, assess and address the problem. Therefore, an ANN has been built with 2 hidden layers to predict the disturbances which enables the authorities to take precautionary action to minimize the impact.
